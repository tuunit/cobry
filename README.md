Cobry is library for creating powerful and modern CLI applications by providing a simple to follow architecture. It helps you to create clean and easy to use CLI applications like git, kubectl or helm.

On further notice, cobry is a python port (WIP) of the popular GO CLI creation library [Cobra|(https://github.com/spf13/cobra)]. It aims to be as versatile as the original library and brings the clean architecture and concepts as defined for cobra into the python ecosystem.
